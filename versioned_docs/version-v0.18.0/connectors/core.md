# Core

The `Core SDK` is:

- An interpreter for the [Phoenix Configuration Language](../sequence-configuration-language.md)
- A collection of [application-independent Steps](/steps/Core) that:
  - Can be used to import/export data and structure workflows
  - Manipulate strings, e.g. Append, Concatenate, ChangeCase
  - Enforce data standards and convert between various formats through the use of Schemas
  - Create and manipulate entities (structured objects that represent data)
  - Control flow, e.g. If, ForEach, While
  - Perform basic mathematical and logical operations
  - Download data from the web
- An SDK that allows [developers to create Connectors](../developers-guide.md)

To try Core in action, start with the [Quick Start](../quick-start.md) and
then try some of the [Examples](../examples/core.md).

[Core SCL examples available here](../examples/core.md).

Source code available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Phoenix/core).
